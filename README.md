1. Responsive Design: Optimized for different screen sizes and devices. The layout correctly adapts for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens, ensuring a great user experience everywhere.
2. Mobile Navigation (Burger Menu): For smaller screens, the main navigation collapses into a user-friendly "burger" menu, which expands on click.
3. Smooth Scroll Navigation: Clicking on navigation links (About us, Catalog, Contacts) provides a smooth scrolling animation to the corresponding section of the page.
4. Semantic HTML5 Layout: The project is built using modern, semantic HTML5 tags (<header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, etc.), which improves SEO and accessibility.
5. Cross-Browser Compatibility: The layout is designed to be compatible with modern web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari.
